    - heading "What is Burni?" [level=2]
    - paragraph: Burni is more than just a token. It’s a promise for a deflationary future. At Burni’s core is a mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation to potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens.
    - heading "The Secret of Token Burning" [level=3]
    - paragraph: Imagine tokens being burned like logs in a magical fire. They disappear forever! This process, called "token burning," reduces the total supply of Burni tokens. Fewer tokens can mean each one becomes more valuable, similar to rare collectibles.

    - text: What does "Blackholed" mean?
    - tooltip "When a token issuer is \"blackholed\", it means the issuing address has renounced its rights to mint new tokens or change token properties. This makes the maximum supply truly fixed."
